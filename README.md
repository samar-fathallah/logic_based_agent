# logic_based_agent
logic based version of Neo the agent using Prolog
 A logic-based
agent operates by storing sentences about the world in its knowledge base, using an
inference mechanism to infer new sentences, and using these sentences to decide which
actions to take.
The project consists of 
a) A successor-state axiom for each fluent in Matrix.pl using built-in predicates when possible.
c) A predicate goal(S) to query the agentâ€™s KB to generate a plan
that Neo can follow to collect all the hostages and head to the cell where the
telephone booth lies. The result of
the query should be a situation described as the result of doing some sequence of
actions from the initial situation s0.
